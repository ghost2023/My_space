            Do you think your living an ordinary life? You are so mistaken its
            difficult to even explain. The mere fact that you exist makes you
            extraordinary. The odds of you existing are less than winning the
            lottery, but here you are. Are you going to let this extraordinary
            opportunity pass? Indescribable oppression, which seemed to generate
            in some unfamiliar part of her consciousness, filled her whole being
            with a vague anguish. It was like a shadow, like a mist passing
            across her souls summer day. It was strange and unfamiliar; it was a
            mood. She did not sit there inwardly upbraiding her husband,
            lamenting at Fate, which had directed her footsteps to the path
            which they had taken. She was just having a good cry all to herself.
            The mosquitoes made merry over her, biting her firm, round arms and
            nipping at her bare insteps. It was like a shadow, like a mist
            passing across her souls summer day. It was strange and unfamiliar;
            it was a mood.
